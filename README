DESCRIPTION
    The Catalyst::Authentication::Store::Fey::ORM class provides access to
    authentication information stored in a database via Fey::ORM.

METHODS
  new ( $config, $app )
    Constructs a new store object.

  from_session ( $c, $frozenuser )
    Revives a user from the session based on the info provided in
    $frozenuser. Currently treats $frozenuser as an id and retrieves a user
    with a matching id.

  for_session ( $c, $user )
    Prepares a user to be stored in the session. Currently returns the value
    of the user's id field (as indicated by the 'id_field' config element).

  find_user ( $authinfo, $c )
    Finds a user using the information provided in the $authinfo hashref and
    returns the user, or undef on failure. This is usually called from the
    Credential. This translates directly to a call to
    Catalyst::Authentication::Store::Fey::ORM::User's load() method.

CONFIGURATION
    The Fey::ORM storage module has several configuration options.

    class
    user_model
    id_field
    role_column
    role_field
    role_relation
    use_userdata_from_session
